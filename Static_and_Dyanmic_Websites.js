Static Websites and Dynamic Websites are two common types of websites with distinct characteristics:

Static Websites:

Static websites consist of fixed content and display the same information to all users. The content is hardcoded into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
They do not involve server-side processing or a database. The files are served as they are from the server to the client.
Changes to the website require manual editing of the HTML files and redeployment of the entire site.
Static websites are typically suited for simple websites with relatively static content, such as portfolios, landing pages, or informational sites.
Dynamic Websites:

Dynamic websites generate content dynamically based on user interactions, database queries, or other external data sources.
They use server-side technologies (like Node.js, PHP, Python, etc.) to process requests, retrieve data, and generate HTML content on the server.
Dynamic websites often utilize a database to store and retrieve data, allowing for real-time content updates and personalized experiences for users.
Content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla are examples of dynamic website platforms that enable content editing and management.
Dynamic websites are suitable for sites that require frequent content updates, user-generated content, e-commerce functionality, or interactive features.
Apart from static and dynamic websites, there are other types of websites as well:

Single-Page Applications (SPAs):

SPAs are websites that load a single HTML page and dynamically update its content without refreshing the entire page.
They often use frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to handle client-side rendering and handle application logic.
SPAs provide a smooth and responsive user experience, as they can load data asynchronously and update specific parts of the page dynamically.
E-commerce Websites:

E-commerce websites are online platforms that facilitate buying and selling of products or services.
They typically have features like product listings, shopping carts, secure payment gateways, and order processing systems.
Blogging Platforms:

Blogging platforms, such as WordPress, Medium, or Ghost, are designed for publishing and managing blog posts and articles.
They offer features like content creation, publishing, categorization, commenting, and social sharing.
Social Networking Websites:

Social networking websites like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn connect individuals and allow them to interact, share content, and build networks.
These are just a few examples, and websites can vary greatly in their functionality and purpose. The choice of website type depends on the specific requirements and goals of a project.

Static and dynamic websites are two fundamental types of websites, each with its own characteristics and use cases.

Static Websites: Static websites are the simplest type of websites and are built using only HTML and CSS. They do not use any server-side scripting, and every page is coded and saved individually. Each page displays the same fixed content to every visitor. Static websites are often used for small websites or landing pages where the content does not need to change dynamically. They are easier and faster to develop but can be difficult to maintain, especially for larger websites [4].
Example of a static website:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>

    <h1>Welcome to My Homepage</h1>
    <p>Some text.</p>

    </body>
    </html>
    ```
Dynamic Websites: Dynamic websites use server-side scripting to generate web pages on the fly. They can display different content to different users from the same source code. Dynamic websites often use a database to store data and a server-side language like PHP, ASP.NET, or Node.js to retrieve and display the data. They are more complex to develop but are easier to update and maintain, making them suitable for large websites or web applications [4].
Example of a dynamic website (using Node.js and Express):
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Welcome to My Homepage');
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server started on port 3000');
    });
    ```
There are other types of websites like e-commerce websites, blog or news websites, social media websites, etc. However, these are more about the website's function rather than its technical implementation. They can be either static or dynamic, depending on their specific requirements [2].

The choice between a static and a dynamic website depends on your specific needs. If you need a simple website with a few pages and don't plan to update it often, a static website might be a good choice. If you need a website that can handle user interactions, display personalized content, or manage a large amount of content, a dynamic website would be more appropriate [4].
